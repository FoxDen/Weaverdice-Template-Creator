# Weaverdice-Template-Creator
Exactly what it says on the tin. A template generator for a homebrewed RPG set in the wormverse.

Due to the limited functionality of Google Apps Script as well as my own inexperience, there are several things that the user should do following the campaign generation.

# Features:
* Create and insert sections anywhere with your custom heading/text font.
* Create logs of various types with prewritten session templates already attached. No need to carefully resize/color anymore. Special sessions (like PHO threads) have their own session template preattached.
* Quickly add new groups and people with only minor editing and adjustments needed. 
* Focus more on your RP and less on prettifying your work!
* Want to change cities, increment months, ect? Update the addon through the customizations tab.

# Procedure
1) Click the menu item saying, "Create Campaign Document". Afterwards, input all relevant information into the form. 
2) Click the submit button.
3) ???
4) Profit!

# After First Creation 
1) Create a custom map in Google Maps. Link this to your new document. 
2) Adjust the sizes of the tables as needed in the Player Info and Sessions pages.
3) For the key in the Sessions page, be sure to wrap the tables in another table. Make the border of this outer table dotted.
4) Move all of the files into the correct folders.

# After general use
1) Be sure to remove the borders from the left and right sides of any 'custom sections' you're using!
2) Be sure to merge the top and bottom half of created logs together. You can also delete one and change the link URL of the other to the name you want. 

# POTENTIAL ISSUES/FAQ
Q: I already have a campaign but I'd like to use this addon for it.
A: Use the customizations tab. You can still create your own logs and sections for it.

Q: The fonts aren't working!
A: The fonts have to be capitalized and available in Google Fonts. Otherwise it will default to the current Google Docs font.

Q: Some of the entries are italic/bold/colored differently?
A: Your Google Docs pointer might be the cause. Make sure it is a new document that you run the Addon in, or that it is not bolded, a different color, or italicized.

Q: It's only Weaverdice?
A: Further updates to this addon will allow you to create more generic GM info docs or Pact Dice docs.
