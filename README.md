# Weaverdice-Template-Creator
Exactly what it says on the tin. A template generator for a homebrewed RPG set in the wormverse.

Due to the limited functionality of Google Apps Script as well as my own inexperience, there are several things that the user should do following the campaign generation.

# After First Creation 
1) Create a custom map in Google Maps. Link this to your new document.
2) Adjust the sizes of the tables as needed in the Player Info and Sessions pages. Color the 'Dead and Gone' headers as you wish.
3) For the key in the Sessions page, be sure to wrap the tables in another table. Make the border of this outer table dots.

# Afterwards
1) Be sure to remove the borders from the left and right sides of any 'custom sections' you're using!
2) Be sure to merge the top and bottom half of the logs together. You can also delete one and change the link URL to the one you want.
