      This project is an attempt to ease the dipping of feet into Weaverdice GMing (although it is usable for other
      loggable games). Specifically, in the style done through the Parahumans IRC. There have been disparate, 
      separate templates available for use before, but this addon attempts to not only bring them together but also 
      make it easier for a GM to create the required documents for running a Worm game inside the IRC.

      Naturally, this is not true for all games. If you have something else in mind, feel free to use it! This template
      simply attempts to copy what has been done in many other Weaverdice campaigns in the past.

      Several templates were used to build this. 
      I would like to give credit to Antioch for the session template, Teller, for the
      log formatter. Saff, for the PHO forum template (If I'm wrong, please let me know!)
